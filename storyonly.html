<p>INDIANAPOLIS - The kids felt it first. The day the governor declared refugees like them unwelcome, fear pulsed through their schools. </p>

<p>Rama, the 15-year-old, heard it in her classmates&rsquo; voices when they blamed Muslims, saw it when they pointed at her headscarf. Rakan, her 13-year-old brother, was caught off guard when a group of boys approached him in the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in ISIS?&rdquo; they asked him. He shook his head and slinked away. </p>

<p>Like the rest of their family, the two teenagers knew about the terror in Paris the previous Friday, the bombings and gunfire that left more than 100 people dead. They knew that ISIS had claimed responsibility for the attacks and that a fake Syrian passport had been left at the scene. But news of Gov. Mike Pence&rsquo;s announcement the following Monday hadn&rsquo;t reached them. </p>

<p>When the Batman family heard that Pence was blocking Syrian refugees from entering Indiana, their small apartment fell silent. </p>

<p>Ten seconds passed. Fifteen, then twenty. Marwan, the father, was the first to speak. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Call?&rdquo; he asked in his broken English, holding up a cell phone. &ldquo;Call?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marwan didn&rsquo;t know the governor&rsquo;s name and didn't understand that getting him on the phone would be almost impossible. Over the rims of his glasses, he looked over at his wife, at Rama and Rakan, at his two youngest daughters chasing each other up and down the staircase.</p>

<p>If Marwan could just talk to the governor, maybe he could tell him his family's story. Maybe he could help the man understand.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The Batman family is among a handful of Syrian families who have fled the civil war in their country and settled in Indiana, joining about two thousand Syrian refugees living across the United States. Since the terrorist attacks in Paris, they have been swept up in a national wave of paranoia and hatred directed against Muslims.</p>

<p>In Chicago, two men were prevented from boarding a plane after they were overheard speaking Arabic. Human feces and pages ripped from a Koran were thrown at the door of a Texas mosque. A few hours drive from that mosque, protestors outside an Islamic center carried picket signs and 12-gauge shotguns.</p>

<p>An Indianapolis volunteer told the city&rsquo;s small community of Syrians to stay in their homes. &ldquo;People are angry,&rdquo; she texted them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo;  Citing concerns of terrorism, more than half the country&rsquo;s governors announced plans to oppose or block Syrian refugees from settling in their states. Pence was one of the first. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Indiana has a long tradition of opening our arms and homes to refugees from around the world,&quot; Pence said in a statement. &quot;But as governor, my first responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of all Hoosiers.&rdquo; </p>

<p>When Pence made his announcement, a new family of Syrian refugees was scheduled to fly into Indianapolis the next day. They never made it. The couple and their small child were rerouted to Connecticut, where the governor publicly welcomed them to the state and mocked Pence&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the same guy who signed a homophobic bill in the spring, surrounded by homophobes,&rdquo; Gov. Dannel Malloy said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not surprised by anything the governor does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As masses of Syrians huddled outside European borders and in cramped refugee camps in Turkey and Iran, they became the central figures in a debate over the soul of America. Would a nation founded by refugees now turn them away?</p>

<p>Politicians labeled them as terrorists-in-wait, saying the United States&rsquo; intensive screening process couldn&rsquo;t catch everything. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Highly concerning,&rdquo; said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is clear that the influx of Syrian refugees poses a threat,&rdquo; said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do everything humanly possible to stop any plans&#8230; to put Syrian refugees in Mississippi,&rdquo; said Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant.</p>

<p>Donald Trump suggested the refugees could be a &ldquo;Trojan horse&rdquo; for terrorism, and promised to send them back if he is elected. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz offered plans to accept only Christian refugees. </p>

<p>President Obama condemned the blockade, calling it &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; and &ldquo;not American.&rdquo; He declared the United States would continue to accept refugees. </p>

<p>As America argued, the flood of people rushing out of Syria continued. More than nine million Syrians have been forced out of their homes in the last five years as casualties of an ever-escalating civil war. Of those, more than 4 million have fled the country.</p>

<p>This summer, President Obama pledged to take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. The country has made little progress on that plan before it became America&rsquo;s most hotly debated policy. </p>

<p>The United Nations has recommended more than 22,000 Syrian refugees for resettlement in the United States since 2013. After a screening process that can take as long as two years, about 2,000 have been accepted. </p>

<p>The Batmans were among the first Syrian refugees to settle in Indiana. Together, they are navigating a world they can&rsquo;t understand: learning English, starting school and paying bills while the country decides what to do with them. </p>

<p>When they arrived, everything was new. Rakan knew his last name &ndash; Batman, like the superhero &ndash; was popular in America, but not much else. </p>

<p>A year later, the family&rsquo;s future is laid out in a series of milestones: apply for green cards in November, college for Rama and Rakan, citizenship in five years, get the rest of their family out of Syria. Go back only after the war. </p>

<p>After the country&rsquo;s leaders turned their back on refugees like them, they felt their future here slipping away. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Marwan sliced another piece of chicken fat off a metal rod taller than he is. Tucked away in the back of Al-Rayan restaurant, his thoughts were 6,000 miles away, back home in Syria. He remembered his own restaurant, where he stood at the front, never hidden in a corner. </p>

<p>He is 47, a short man with gray hair and fingers scarred from an accident with a meat grinder. Smiling is his permanent state. He knows just a few words of English, but laughs at almost everything he hears anyway. For now, he&rsquo;s stuck in the back corner of an empty restaurant, but he swears he&rsquo;ll be friends with President Obama before the year is out. </p>

<p>He sighed and started to sing, sending the off-key warbles of an old Syrian love song, &ldquo;Ebatly Gawab,&rdquo; through the restaurant. </p>

<p>I have a God, who knows me&#8230;</p>

<p>From the pain he shields me&#8230;</p>

<p>I will be patient all the time, and endure my pain.</p>

<p>In a country he can&rsquo;t understand, Marwan&rsquo;s songs are his connection home. As he sings, the war fades away. He&rsquo;s back in the small arenas where he once played soccer, in his mother&rsquo;s house, in his own restaurant. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Syria, Arabic restaurant, chef,&rdquo; he said. His eyes flitted back and forth as he tried to translate in his head. He&rsquo;d like to join his wife at her weekly English classes, but can&rsquo;t afford the time away from work. Money for his family or understanding his new world &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t have much of a choice, did he? The restaurant became his classroom.    In Syria, he was owner, operator, host and head chef. In America, he&rsquo;s tucked away in the back of the kitchen, an $8.30-an-hour laborer slicing chicken and singing to himself. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Work good, money good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And then&#8230;&rdquo; He made a fist, lifted it high above his head and brought it crashing down on the cold metal table. The table wobbled.</p>

<p>An explosion. His restaurant destroyed, blown to rubble with the rest of the city. A comfortable life ripped off its foundations. </p>

<p>&ldquo;And then&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, he started over.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>When the Syrian army arrived in Homs, the protestors welcomed them with flowers. </p>

<p>Peace, peace, they chanted. Army and people are one. </p>

<p>In 2011, Homs became the &ldquo;Cradle of the revolution,&rdquo; and the ancient city transformed into the center of Syrian violence. </p>

<p>When summer came, Marwan and his brothers huddled in their mother&rsquo;s home. They followed the news on a cell phone and played cards as bullets bounced off the walls. </p>

<p>Outside, a dozen snipers sat on top of an ancient Syrian castle, rifles pointed at the street below. They shot immediately and indiscriminately, killing whoever set foot outside at night. &ldquo;It was illegal for a human to move,&rdquo; Marwan says. </p>

<p>As the sun fell one evening, Marwan fell asleep in a front room. He awakened to the sound of sniper fire and bolted to the door, where he found Borhan, his older brother, about to step outside, to find bread for the family. </p>

<p> Marwan grabbed his hand. &ldquo;Stop, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo; </p>

<p>As Marwan begged his brother to stay, he saw a neighbor walk past the house. The young newlywed paused to say hello. </p>

<p>A sniper fired. Marwan pulled Borhan inside as he watched his neighbor fall limply to the street. </p>

<p>During the war, brushes with death were a constant. Airstrikes became routine. Parents opened the door to find their children dead on the front stoop. </p>

<p>Marwan let winter come and go, and decided to flee in June 2012. Choosing the risk of daylight over the nighttime snipers, the family piled into a minivan and handed the driver $500 to sneak them into Lebanon. </p>

<p>In Lebanon, they floated through life for two years. Marwan couldn&rsquo;t find work, so Lona sold her jewelry to afford rent and food.</p>

<p>After three interviews with the United Nations, they were granted refugee status and assigned to the United States, home to what&rsquo;s been called the world&rsquo;s most thorough security process.</p>

<p>Marwan and Lona sat through three more interviews, answering the same questions each time. No, they repeated, they weren&rsquo;t planning a terrorist attack. They didn&rsquo;t carry weapons. They weren&rsquo;t planning on committing suicide anytime soon. </p>

<p>&ldquo;They asked how many breaths I took a day,&rdquo; Marwan said, grinning at his exaggeration. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder for Syrians.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Along the way, they were fingerprinted and photographed, given a full medical checkup, tested for infectious diseases and sent to a class on American culture. Their files were sent to Homeland Security officials in the United States, and they waited.</p>

<p>Then, in January 2014, Marwan&rsquo;s phone rang. A U.N. worker told him that his family had been accepted into the United States and would move by the end of the year. </p>

<p>In Syria, they knew almost nothing of America. &ldquo;America bad, Syria good,&rdquo; is all anybody ever told them, Marwan remembers. Their knowledge was limited: Marwan liked cowboy movies, NBA basketball and the TV show &ldquo;Love Boat.&rdquo; </p>

<p>They had never heard of Indiana. </p>

<p>Ten months later, they boarded a plane in Lebanon, carrying eight suitcases stuffed with clothes. They left everything else behind. &ldquo;Our pictures,&rdquo; Lona said, &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo; </p>

<p>After 17 hours of flights, the Batmans landed at Indianapolis International Airport in a chilling rain A volunteer worker met them at the airport with winter coats for the kids, who were dressed for the warmth of Lebanon. </p>

<p>As they pulled on coats and collected their bags, Marwan slipped through a door and stepped outside. He pulled a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and lit one, shivering in the cold as a new life began. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>After Pence&rsquo;s announcement, Indiana drew criticism from across the country. Once again, the governor was forced to defend a controversial decision. </p>

<p>Pence sent a letter to the state&rsquo;s Representatives and Senators. Indiana would continue to accept refugees, he said &ndash; just not Syrians. And it wasn&rsquo;t an outright ban on Syrian refugees, but a pause. </p>

<p>Critics have questioned whether a governor has the power to block refugees from a state in the first place. The Refugee Act of 1980 gives no specific authority to states, and the Obama administration has called refugee resettlement a federal issue. </p>

<p>The ACLU filed a lawsuit against the Governor on behalf of Exodus Refugee Immigration &ndash; the agency that helped the Batmans settle in Indiana. The group called Pence&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;an unconstitutional bluff&rdquo; and told him Exodus would continue to bring Syrian refugees to Indiana. </p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not have the power to pick and choose between which lawfully admitted refugees he is willing to accept,&rdquo; the ACLU&rsquo;s Judy Rabinovitz said in a statement. &ldquo;Singling out Syrian refugees for exclusion from Indiana is not only ethically wrong, it is unconstitutional. Period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Squarely in the center of the hostility, the Batmans have tried to shield themselves from it. They&rsquo;ve stayed inside, focused on laying the foundation of a new life. Marwan earns just over minimum wage at work. Lona takes an English class every Saturday, and studies on her own twice a day. They asked about getting their parents out of Syria, but were told there&rsquo;s little chance. </p>

<p>Since the announcement, Rakan has kept to himself. He didn&rsquo;t speak up when his teachers discussed the Paris attacks, and lowered his eyes when classmates talked about ISIS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was scared,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe they call the government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a Monday morning, Rakan limped through the hallways of Belzer Middle School, headed toward his first-period algebra class. His 13-year-old hips were sore, he said. The day before, he felt like running, so he did, taking off in his jeans and not stopping for four hours.</p>

<p>He walked side-by-side with Faris, his best friend and the school&rsquo;s only other Arabic-speaking student. The school gave them identical schedules, and the two of them spend most of their school days in a silence that breaks only when a teacher asks Rakan to translate for Faris or a classmate shows off the Arabic words Rakan taught them. </p>

<p>As they walked to class, a short boy rushed in front of Rakan and turned to face him, working to keep himself from laughing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Go fuck yourself!&rdquo; he screamed in Arabic. Rakan chuckled and raised his hand for a high-five, showing a black wristwatch. It runs three minutes slow &ndash; always a little behind. </p>

<p>In every class, he sits as close to the teacher&rsquo;s desk as possible. He understands about half of what they say, but falls behind his classmates almost immediately. One teacher said his job is just to get Rakan talking, and any material he learns is a bonus. </p>

<p>So Rakan coasted through his school day, seven hours of head nods and smiles to hide his confusion:</p>

<p>Algebra, where he sat underneath a banner reading &ldquo;The first step in getting ahead is getting started.&rdquo; A worksheet asked him to translate English sentences into mathematical expressions. He finished eight of the 26 questions before the bell rang.</p>

<p>General math, where an online quiz flashed a picture of American money and he struggled to count it. After half a dozen tries and almost 10 minutes, he finally got the total &ndash; $2.77. </p>

<p>Social studies, where a teacher&rsquo;s lesson plan on the history of Islam made him laugh. &ldquo;Abraham doesn&rsquo;t look like that,&rdquo; he says, pointing at the photo of an old white man with a long beard.</p>

<p>Language arts, where Rakan and Faris tried to copy down the word &ldquo;magnanimous&rdquo; and use it in a sentence. The teacher then pulled them into the hallway to practice reading from &ldquo;A Long Walk to Water,&rdquo; a novel about Salva, an 11-year-old Sudanese refugee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We talked about refugees last time,&rdquo; the teacher told Rakan. &ldquo;Salva is a refugee. Do you remember why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rakan didn&rsquo;t look up from the book. &ldquo;Because he had to leave Sudan.&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he lifted his eyes. &ldquo;War.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Rakan ends each day with English as a New Language, his favorite class. Room D201 is covered wall-to-wall with posters and signs written in Spanish &ndash; Julie Majercak caters her lessons to Spanish-speaking students. Rakan barely spoke before the day&rsquo;s final bell rang. </p>

<p>Rakan didn&rsquo;t stop at his locker as he rushes out the door. It&rsquo;s sat empty for months. Somebody gave him the combination a long time ago, but he forgot and isn&rsquo;t sure how to ask for it again. </p>

<p>*** </p>

<p>Nothing in the Batmans&rsquo; apartment matches. </p>

<p>The shower curtain upstairs is covered in American sports: basketballs, baseballs, footballs and tennis racquets. Lona and Marwan&rsquo;s beds &ndash; separate, but just a few feet apart &ndash; are identical, different only in Lona&rsquo;s flowery blue pillowcase and a glimpse of a pink bedsheet. </p>

<p>The walls are empty. No photos. There was no time to grab them when the regime forced them out of their home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything,&rdquo; Rakan muttered.</p>

<p>Lona brought out a tray of pastries, and Marwan gestured upstairs. She headed up and brought down a bulging plastic bag. </p>

<p>Marwan pulled open the drawstrings and dumped half of the bag onto the couch. Three years of paperwork came spilling out. </p>

<p>Unopened envelopes from official-looking addresses. Forms &ndash; some filled out, others left blank. A scan of four stents in Marwan&rsquo;s heart. Medical records. Immigration paperwork. Bills. Almost everything in English. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Paper, paper, paper, paper,&rdquo; Marwan said, eyes bulging as he filed through. He held a housing brochure at an arm&rsquo;s length, then realized it was upside-down. He flipped it over.</p>

<p>He needed their doctor&rsquo;s name. All six of the Batmans needed vaccinations, and time was running out to get them. Their final green-card interview was less than three weeks away. </p>

<p>If Marwan didn&rsquo;t get his family&rsquo;s paperwork filed by then, they would become unauthorized aliens in the United States. Refugees can&rsquo;t be deported, but they would lose their rights in the country, including Marwan&rsquo;s right to work. Everything would unravel in a moment. </p>

<p>Before the applications could be submitted to the government, each family member needed to be vaccinated. To do that, Marwan had to find their doctor. But he couldn&rsquo;t read the forms. </p>

<p>He found a prescription he thought might have the doctor&rsquo;s name on it. &ldquo;Dr. Waller,&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;Family doctor? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Lona didn&rsquo;t remember, either. </p>

<p>He put the prescription on the table and turned back to the pile. Eventually, he found Dr. Waller&rsquo;s name again, on a diagram of Marwan&rsquo;s heart. He&rsquo;s a cardiologist, not their family doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heart doctor,&rdquo; Marwan said, pointing at the surgical scar on his chest. &ldquo;Very nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very nice, but not the right doctor. Marwan shuffled the prescription back into the pile and kept looking. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Marwan, Lona and Rama crowded around a small desk at Exodus Refugee Immigration, shifting in their cold wooden chairs. Behind the desk, Megan Hochbein flicked on her computer and pulled out a thick file. </p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said through an interpreter, &ldquo;We are filing for green cards today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lona pulled out a notebook. Marwan fiddled with a pack of cigarettes in his pocket. Rama sent one last text. The other three children were left at home &ndash; she&rsquo;s the only one old enough to fill out her own application. </p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of paperwork,&rdquo; Hochbein said. &ldquo;At one point, there&rsquo;s going to be a long list of kind of awkward questions we need to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She asked if they&rsquo;ve ever prostituted themselves; if they&rsquo;ve trafficked drugs into the United States; if they intend on practicing polygamy, which made Marwan giggle; if they&rsquo;ve participated in a genocide; if they&rsquo;ve ever been a member of a terrorist group. </p>

<p>All three shook their heads.</p>

<p>Marwan only answered yes twice. Yes, he served in the military, he said. Yes, he received military training. Two years of required service in the Syrian air force, well before the war. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a bus driver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was trained how to assemble and clean the weapons, but I never used it.&rdquo; He explained that he spent most of his service time playing and coaching on the soccer team.</p>

<p>As the pile of finished forms stacked up, the meeting stretched into its third hour. Lona has to take a quick walk in the hallway &ndash; she&rsquo;s had back pain for months, and a doctor&rsquo;s injections haven&rsquo;t helped. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it takes forever,&rdquo; Hochbein said. &ldquo;All of these papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the government processes their applications, they&rsquo;ll be called in for fingerprinting, additional interviews and, possibly, more paperwork. </p>

<p>Hochbein explained it could be as long as seven months before a decision is made on the Batmans&rsquo; applications, and approval isn&rsquo;t a certainty&mdash; even with clean records and a smooth application process. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a guarantee,&rdquo; she said. </p>

<p>Lona&rsquo;s eyes went wide at the idea of being rejected. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>As the Batmans signed each page of their applications, the battle over the fate of Syrian refugees seemed unlikely to settle in the next seven months. </p>

<p>Every Republican presidential candidate has opposed accepting Muslim Syrians into the United States &ndash; all but two are against accepting Syrians entirely. Islamophobia is the strongest it&rsquo;s been since 9/11. </p>

<p>A family of Syrians was scheduled to fly into Indianapolis on Monday. Catholic Charities of Indianapolis had considered defying Pence&rsquo;s wishes and bringing them to Indiana anyway, so Pence called a private meeting with the Archbishop. No exceptions, he told him. The Archbishop said he&rsquo;d think about it.</p>

<p>Tensions swirl around them, and the Batmans try not to notice. As the debate rages, they&rsquo;ll keep the path, building an American life bit-by-bit. </p>

<p>They headed for the car and strapped in. Marwan turned the key, and the CD player started up automatically. He tapped their home address into the car&rsquo;s navigation system. Above them, an almost-full moon floated in an empty sky. </p>

<p>Marwan lit a cigarette and pointed the car toward home. Before they left the parking lot, he was singing again.</p>
